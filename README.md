# Professional README Generator

## README Generator
To get this professional README generator working, I had to first create the questions that Inquirer was going to ask that would help generate the professional README. After generating the questions, I had to create the function that initialize the app and create a README.md file. I also had to create a function that would make sure to pull all of the data that the questions asked in terminal were pulled through and put in the README that had been generated. After finishing with the code on the index.js file, I moved on to the generateMarkdown.js file to make sure that README looked good as well. I used my knowledge of markdowns to create the template that I needed for my professional README. Once the template was done, I filled in the variables of where all the data from the questions were supposed to go in the README. Finally, I ran the application using 'node index.js' to make sure that the application worked correctly.
